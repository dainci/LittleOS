# LittleOS (or AllTools)

LittleOS is an operating system coded entirely in Python, developed from scratch. Although the project is currently an overlay of the existing OS, the ultimate goal is to be able to run it directly on a blank computer.

### Installation

Before running main.py, make sure to open the install.py file in the common folder to install all the modules needed to run the program. For more information, see [How to install](https://github.com/dainci/LittleOS/wiki/How-to-install)

### Features

One of the greatest things about LittleOS is that it allows geeks to have fun, as all the code is in Python and easy to operate. The operating system will be available in several versions, including:

* OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) focused version: Designed for Open Source Intelligence gathering and analysis.
* Dedicated pentesting version: Tailored for penetration testing and security auditing purposes.
* Classic blank version: A general-purpose version for everyday computing needs.

LittleOS primarily relies on a command-line interface, providing a more terminal-oriented computing experience.
